    - "In those days, for a program to be popular enough it 
would have to be written for Windows. As consummate hackers, they loathed 
everything about Windows and had never bothered to learn how to develop 
applications for it. They preferred to write in Lisp and have the program run 
on Unix, the open-source operating system. 

They decided to postpone the inevitable and wrote the program for 
Unix anyway. To translate this later into Window's would be easy, but as they 
contemplated doing this, they realized the terrible consequences it would 
lead to—once the program was launched in Windows, they would have to 
deal with users and perfect the program based on their feedback. This would 
mean they would be forced to think and program in Windows for months, 
perhaps years. This was too awful a prospect, and they seriously considered 
giving up. 

One morning Graham, who had been sleeping on a mattress on the 
floor in Morris’s Manhattan apartment, woke up repealing certain words 
that must have come to him from a dream: “You could control the program 
by clicking on links.” He suddenly sat boll upright, as he realized what these 
words could mean—the possibility of creating a program to set up an online 
store that would run on the web server itself. People would download and 
use it through Netscape, clicking various links on the web page to set it up. 
This would mean he and Morris would bypass tire usual route of writing a 
program that users would download to their desktop. It would cut out the 
need ever to have to dabble in Windows. There was nothing out there like 
this, and yet it seemed like such an obvious solution. In a state of excitement 
he explained his epiphany to Morris, and they agreed to give it a try. Within 
a few days they finished the first version, and it functioned beautifully. 
Clearly, the concept of a web application would work."
    - "To help yourself to cultivate serendipity, you should keep a notebook with you at all times. The moment any idea or observation comes, you note 
it down. You keep the notebook by your bed, careful to record ideas that 
come in those moments of fringe awareness—just before falling asleep, or 
just upon waking. In this notebook you record any scrap of thought that 
occurs to you, and include drawings, quotes from other books, anything at 
all. In this way, you will have the freedom to try out the most absurd ideas. 
The juxtaposition of so many random bits will be enough to spark various 
associations. 

In general you must adopt a more analogical way of thinking, taking 
greater advantage of the associative powers of the mind. Thinking in terms 
of analogies and metaphors can be extremely helpful to the creative process. For instance, an argument people used in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries to prove that the earth does not move was to say that a rock dropped 
from a tower lands at its base. If the earth were moving, they argued, it would 
fall elsewhere. Galileo, a man who habitually thought in terms of analogies, 
saw the earth in his mind as a kind of sailing ship in space. As he explained 
to doubters of the earth’s movement, a rock dropped from the mast of a moving ship still tands at its base. 

These analogies can be tight and logical, such as Isaac Newton’s comparison of the falling apple from a tree in his garden to the moon falling in 
space. Or they can be loose and somewhat irrational, such as the jazz artist 
John Coltrane’s thinking of his own compositions as cathedrals of sound he 
was constructing. In any event, you must train yourself to look constantly 
for such analogies to reframe and expand your ideas."
    - "In order to work, the writer Samuel Johnson required that he had on his desk a cat, which he would periodically stroke to make it purr, and a slice of orange. Supposedly only these various sensual cues could properly stimulate him for his work. 

These examples are all related to the phenomenon of synesthesia- 
moments in which the stimulation of one sense provokes another. For instance, we hear a particular sound and it makes us think of a color. Studies 
have indicated that synesthesia is far more prevalent among artists and high- 
level thinkers. Some have speculated that synesthesia represents a high 
degree of interconnectivity in the brain, which also plays a role in intelligence. Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their 
senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate 
their thoughts on many levels—whether it be the smell of something strong, 
or the tactile feel of a rubber ball. What this means is that they are more open 
to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow 
themselves a broader range of sense experience. You must expand as well 
your notion of Lhinking and creativity beyond the confines of words and 
iniellectualizaiions. Stimulating your brain and senses from all directions 
will help unlock your natural creativity and help revive your original mind."
    - "As it panned out, the novelty of their idea, which Graham and Morris 
had come upon largely because of their distaste for Windows, proved to 
have all kinds of unforeseen advantages. Working directly on the Internet, 
they could generate a continuous stream of new releases of the software and 
test them right away. They could interact directly with consumers, getting 
instant feedback on their program and improving it in days rather than the 
months it could take with desktop software. With no experience running a 
business, they did not think to hire salespeople to do the pitching; instead, 
they made the phone calls to potential clients themselves. But as they were 
the de facto salespeople, they were also the first to hear complaints or suggestions from consumers, and this gave them a real feel for the program’s weaknesses and how to improve it. Because it was so unique and came out of left 
field, they had no competitors to worry about; nobody could steal the idea 
because they were the only ones who were insane enough to attempt it."
