    - The poor struggle to make the ends meet, the middle class works for money but can't handle it, the rich make the money work for them
    - You can buy assets or liabilities. The rich buy assets, the poor and middle-class mostly buy liabilities.
    - The assets are the things you own that work for you. It can be real-estate, products you sell, companies you own, etc.
    - There's a separate kind of assets called portfolio which encompasses stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments that earn money (as oppossed to savings that mainly maintain their worth).
    - I loved the lessons about making money and learning to sell.
    - The author emphasizes investing in your marketing and sales skills if you want to be rich. This is something I discovered only in the recent years and I wished I knew about it earlier (instead I thought that getting better at my job would be the best investment).
    - I liked how the author interjected some cross-sales of his other products throughout the book. It was unobtrusive, informative, and entertaining. I wish the regular self-advertisements were that good!
    - The book is heavily biased towards real-estate investments. I understand this is because that's the author's favorite, but the other types of income should get some more time as well.
    - The sell before you buy principle was really good. It's something indie hackers use to research if there's a market fit. First look for someone who is willing to buy a given asset (real-estate, product, services) and only then acquire the asset at a lower price (find an occassion, build a product, hire freelancers).
    - I liked how the author mentioned that group discounts are a thing and whenever you want to buy something, find a group of people with similar needs and negotiate a discout. I've been using this tactic to buy theatre tickets, concert tickets, cheap accomodation, clothes, and other stuff ever since I remember.
    - Before he became a real-estate investor, the author was a very successful salesperson. This shows where his influence and negotiation skills probably come from (or where they were developed). I wonder whether a similar feat is possible for those who don't necessarly have experience in sales.
    - Once again, after "Nudge", it was quite an uncomfortable read. It made me realize how much have I been missing my entire professional life. It brought some anxiety, but also (ironically) a nudge to act.
    - Altough the book focuses on how to get financial independence, the author admits he started his sales career doing a lot of work and becoming the best salesperson. This is the classical "work hard, put in long hours, and after some time you will *make it*". The author admits that right now, the best deals come from a little work, but he started in the usual overworked way. I'm really curious to learn about people who became financially independent *without* putting extra hours or even putting less hours to work than most ("The 4-Hour Workweek" is not that book, BTW).
