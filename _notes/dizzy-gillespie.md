    - During the 1964 United States presidential campaign, Gillespie put himself forward as an independent write-in candidate. He promised that if he were elected, the White House would be renamed the Blues House, and he would have a cabinet composed of [Duke Ellington](/duke-ellington){: .internal-link} (Secretary of State), [Miles Davis](/miles-davis){: .internal-link} (Director of the CIA), [Max Roach](/max-roach){: .internal-link} (Secretary of Defense), [Charles Mingus](/charles-mingus){: .internal-link} (Secretary of Peace), [Ray Charles](/ray-charles){: .internal-link} (Librarian of Congress), [Louis Armstrong](/louis-armstrong){: .internal-link} (Secretary of Agriculture), [Mary Lou Williams](/mary-lou-williams){: .internal-link} (Ambassador to the Vatican), [Thelonious Monk](/thelonious-monk){: .internal-link} (Travelling Ambassador) and [Malcolm X](/malcolm-x){: .internal-link} (Attorney General). He said his running mate would be [Phyllis Diller](/phyllis-diller){: .internal-link}. Campaign buttons had been manufactured years before by Gillespie's booking agency as a joke but proceeds went to Congress of Racial Equality, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and [Martin Luther King Jr.](/martin-luther-king-jr.){: .internal-link}; in later years they became a collector's item. In 1971, he announced he would run again but withdrew before the election.
