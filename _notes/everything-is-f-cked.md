    - The begining of the book references concentration campswhich reminded me of [A Man's Search for Meaning](/a-man's-search-for-meaning){: .internal-link}. However, when it comes to style, I much preferred [Victor L. Frankl](/victor-l.-frankl){: .internal-link}'s one.
    - I don't know why the author insists on using a lot of expletives, but it doesn't help with his message. One of the observations is that instead of looking for truth, people are looking for happiness and convenience. Yet, the simplistic and vulgar style suits better those convenient messages, rather than philosophical thougts (to which this book aspires).

    - One of the last chapters references [Antifragile](/antifragile){: .internal-link} and contains advice that we should make ourselves antifragile to have better experience in this world.
    - Somewhere at the beginning the author mentioned a thinking and feeling brain metaphor that I didn't quite like. I really loved the comparison of thinking brain to the elephant rider and the feeling brain to the elephant as presented in [The Happiness Hypothesis](/the-happiness-hypothesis){: .internal-link}. As it turns out, this book is also referenced a bit later in the same chapter.
