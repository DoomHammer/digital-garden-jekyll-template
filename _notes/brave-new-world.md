    - "Of course it is," the Controller agreed. "But that's the price we have to pay for stability. You've got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We've sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead."
    - "Of course it does. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand."
    - "We could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. But we don't. We prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. For their own sakes–because it takes __longer__ to get food out of the land than out of a factory. Besides, we have our stability to think of. We don't want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. That's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. Yes, even science."
    - "Yes," Mustapha Mond was saying, "that's another item in the cost of stability. It isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also science. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled."
    - The dialog between [John (the Savage)](/john-(the-savage)){: .internal-link} and [Mustapha Mond](/mustapha-mond){: .internal-link} reminds me of how [Everything is F*cked](/everything-is-f-cked){: .internal-link} mentioned that optimising for happiness instead of truth is a way towards disaster.

    - [Everything is F*cked](/everything-is-f-cked){: .internal-link} mentioned that [Freedom is not Free](/freedom-is-not-free){: .internal-link}. In a dialogue between [John (the Savage)](/john-(the-savage)){: .internal-link} and [Mustapha Mond](/mustapha-mond){: .internal-link}, John desires the freedom to be unhappy, the freedom to struggle, and the freedom to suffer. Citizens in the World State are protected from the unhappy as this may lead to instability.
