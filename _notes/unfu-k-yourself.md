- [BookNotes](/booknotes){: .internal-link} [Unfu*k Yourself](/unfu-k-yourself){: .internal-link}
    - I've listened to it as an audiobook read by the author, [Gary John Bishop](/gary-john-bishop){: .internal-link}. I so loved the Scottish accent!
    - The book is more or less a collection of affirmations with the acompanying rationale to why these affirmations are important.
    - Rather than a book, I will call it a script for a motivational speech with a twist. What's the twist? The twist is that the author denounces most motivational speeches and instead on positivity, he focuses on rationality.
    - The book is full of quotes, mostly from stoic philosophers. At first, I thought this was a nice addition. After a while, I got a little bored by how they are placed.
    - Fun fact: it made me realize body building is not only about body building. It is also about learning how to pose. In other words: what we see is not how well does the body builder look. It is how well the body builder can pose with the given body.
    - One point reminded me of [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things){: .internal-link}. It was the bias towards action instead of dwelling on your thoughts and worries. It struck me as I'm particularly guilty of overthinking and having trouble making the decision. [Ben Horowitz](/ben-horowitz){: .internal-link} mentioned that one of the features of a great CEO is the ability to make a decision and stick to it even if it's tough and there's a high uncertainty about it. That's what people expect from a great CEO. You won't please everybody, so decide on what to do and start doing it. Good thoughts are fine, but you are judged by your actions.
