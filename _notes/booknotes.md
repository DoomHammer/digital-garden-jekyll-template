    - The book is very US-centric, for this reason alone it is not recommended for people living outside US.
    - With the way the US works, we see it's a perfect ground for burnout: student debt, expensive health care, crazy real estate prices.
    - The majority of people in the US have a lot of responsibilities due to the above facts, but very little control over how to approach them.
    - Responsibility without agency is a simple way to burnout (illustrated with a case of social workers).
    - The only universal insights I found in this book are those that mirrored Viktor Frankl's "A Man's Search for Meaning" and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi "Flow".
    - If your job or life doesn't have a meaning, you'll burn out quickly.
    - If your job or life provides flow (the feeling of getting lost in an activity that provides just enough challenge to keep you stimulated) you'll be less prone to burnout.
    - Coding is a career that is known to provide flow which is good. On the other hand, it can also provide responsibility without agency which is burnout-inducing.
    - Your job is not your life. Your job is not who you are. Defining yoursefl only in terms of your job and professional achievements is a way to burnout.
    - Invest (your time) in hobbies and social interactions to balance the stress generated by your job.

    - Don't use the words against yourself
    - Take nothing personally
    - Ask questions instead of making assumptions
    - Always do your best even if the goal constantly changes


- [BookNotes](/booknotes){: .internal-link} [Rich Dad Poor Dad](/rich-dad-poor-dad){: .internal-link}
    - The poor struggle to make the ends meet, the middle class works for money but can't handle it, the rich make the money work for them
    - You can buy assets or liabilities. The rich buy assets, the poor and middle-class mostly buy liabilities.
    - The assets are the things you own that work for you. It can be real-estate, products you sell, companies you own, etc.
    - There's a separate kind of assets called portfolio which encompasses stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments that earn money (as oppossed to savings that mainly maintain their worth).
    - I loved the lessons about making money and learning to sell.
    - The author emphasizes investing in your marketing and sales skills if you want to be rich. This is something I discovered only in the recent years and I wished I knew about it earlier (instead I thought that getting better at my job would be the best investment).
    - I liked how the author interjected some cross-sales of his other products throughout the book. It was unobtrusive, informative, and entertaining. I wish the regular self-advertisements were that good!
    - The book is heavily biased towards real-estate investments. I understand this is because that's the author's favorite, but the other types of income should get some more time as well.
    - The sell before you buy principle was really good. It's something indie hackers use to research if there's a market fit. First look for someone who is willing to buy a given asset (real-estate, product, services) and only then acquire the asset at a lower price (find an occassion, build a product, hire freelancers).
    - I liked how the author mentioned that group discounts are a thing and whenever you want to buy something, find a group of people with similar needs and negotiate a discout. I've been using this tactic to buy theatre tickets, concert tickets, cheap accomodation, clothes, and other stuff ever since I remember.
    - Before he became a real-estate investor, the author was a very successful salesperson. This shows where his influence and negotiation skills probably come from (or where they were developed). I wonder whether a similar feat is possible for those who don't necessarly have experience in sales.
    - Once again, after "Nudge", it was quite an uncomfortable read. It made me realize how much have I been missing my entire professional life. It brought some anxiety, but also (ironically) a nudge to act.
    - Altough the book focuses on how to get financial independence, the author admits he started his sales career doing a lot of work and becoming the best salesperson. This is the classical "work hard, put in long hours, and after some time you will *make it*". The author admits that right now, the best deals come from a little work, but he started in the usual overworked way. I'm really curious to learn about people who became financially independent *without* putting extra hours or even putting less hours to work than most ("The 4-Hour Workweek" is not that book, BTW).

    - The author mentions a moment where he decided he has to make a serious choice as he can't follow all his projects, passions, and interests and still have family. After that realization he left his startup job to get something more stable. This choice, however, didn't prevent him from founding a startup in the future. And one that would take him even farther from his family at times. I find this rather inconsistent.
    - Netscape came to be as a commercial approach to Mosaic (the first graphical Web browser). To this day, Mosaic Killer (Mozilla) is an important Web Browser and a proponent of the free Web.
    - One of author's companies, Loudcloud, was financed by SoftBank. I didn't know SoftBank existed in the nineties. Nowadays, SoftBank looks to me like one of the most evil companies around.

    - Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great advice in the book. But it's another example of "work 16h days to make it or you're nothing".
    - The author mentions in tech you have to be great or you lose. I'm not sure about it and I definitely believe outside of tech you can be just good and still be fine.
    - The story of keeping an executive with cancer on a payroll long enough so he can get health insurance was touching. However, it shows how broken the US health system is. If your literal life is a matter of your employer's decision, is it very different from slavery?
    - Another comment on the cancer story, the author mentions that the company was fighting for survival so he had more empathy for a person with cancer fighting for survival. I found this analogy extremely insensitive. Your company may not survive and you are still free to take the most of life, maybe just lowering your leisure expectations. When you have cancer, not surviving means something entirely different.

    - There are a lot of excuses in this book. "We did something bad, but we had to do this to survive". No you didn't. Survival of your company might have been at stake, but not *your* survival, neither that of your employees (unless in the United States you die when you become unemployed).
    - This is yet another book focused mostly on public companies with huge teams. I haven't yet found a good book talking about bootstrapped small to medium companies.
    - There's a lot of war metaphores. Hiring a general, curshing the compatition, and so on. Why it is highly poetic, it is used to justify terrible beahvior. When you're in war, all that matter is whether you win or lose, so you can do just about anything to achieve your goal. Well, I see it as excuses, but then again I've never been a CEO of a publicly traded company.

    - Don't get me wrong, the book contains a lot of great advice, the problem is most of it targets US-based publicly traded tech companies or tech companies with external funding.
    - I loved the suggestions for performing 1-on-1 management meetings!
    - I was surprised by the description of toxic employee behaviors, as I realized it matched my behavior at one job perfectly! Because I saw what was rotten in a company (or sepcifically, a project I was in) and not being able to do anything about it I turned very sour and complained a lot.

    - Day 2 of listening to The Sandman Audio Drama.

It's still very very good! The team managed to convey the original atmosphere and add a few gifts of their own.

    - Day 3 of The Sandman Audio Drama.

I wonder if I'll be able to follow the plot if I haven't read the original first. That said, it's still great and evoking all the emotions that were present when I first read it.

Too bad no "Mr. Sandman" or "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (yet)

    - In one of the chapters, the author mentions that children should not be bother while skating. This has something to do with mastery. But the topic of mastery is almost as soon forgotten as it has been mentioned. Instead, we get a lot of preaching on topics that are almost unrelated.
    - One of the subchapters is titled "Compassion as a Vice" and the author suggests that avoiding conflict is equal to allowing others walk on you which are hardly the same thing. 
    - The book is a mix of science, personal anecdotes, personal world-view of an author, and some wisdom. This reminds me of "[Antifragile](/antifragile){: .internal-link}". While I disliked the brutal and barbaric style of [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](/nassim-nicholas-taleb){: .internal-link}, I very much liked the content and I can recommend the book wholeheartadly. At the same time, the style presented by Jordan B. Peterson is much more pleasant and in almost all means better but at the same time, it just feels filled with fluff. Taleb comes straight to the point and the anecdotes make the point stronger, Peterson, from my perspective, rather dilutes the topic and most of the text is not meant to support the rules presented in the book.

It's "The Doll's House" and it's still splendid. Lovely! Better than I expected ( which is rarely the case with adaptations for me)

Also, I feel I'm watched by a gargoyle.

Meep?

    - One of my favorite stories from "The Sandman" has always been "[A Dream of a Thousand Cats](/a-dream-of-a-thousand-cats){: .internal-link}".

It is astory about how dreams shape the world. And at that, it is one of the truest and most human stories. After all, the only advantage homo sapiens has over other animals is our ability to turn our dreams into reality. To shape the world we live in according to our dreams.

If enough people can dream that money is good for trade then trade can happen.

If enough people believe democracy is the way to govern the world, ...
    - ...the democracy can happen.

If enough people believe in the Internet, the Internet can happen.

We live in the world of our dreams.

But "A Dream of a Thousand Cats" touches other topics as well.

It is a story about the power of the collective. About the drawbacks...
    - ...of individualism and selfishness.

I've seen a few beautiful things crumble, because the people that made them stopped dreaming the same dreams.

"A Dream of a Thousand Cats" is also the most human, because it shows not only our power but also our cruelty. In that, ...
    - ...it reminds me of "Sapiens" by [Yuval Noah Harari](/yuval-noah-harari){: .internal-link}.

It also shows that freedom can be easily gave up in exchange for comfort. And that we will fool oursleves that this comfort comes at modest price (isn't it similar to what we do with our personal data right now?).

When I read ...
    - ...it for the first time, I wouldn't dream to hear it one day narrated by

But as it turned out, thanks to The Sandman Audio Drama, I had this wonderful opportunity.

Even though, it is part of "The Sandman", this story works very well out of context. You can...
    - ...read it without touching the rest of the series and you will get the main point.

And if you are anything like me, you'll be touched by it.

If you get this far, ask yourself what your dreams are. Then, ask yourself how you may realize them. If you find enough people who...
    - ...will share those dreams with you, one day, your dreams may become reality.

    - "Of course it is," the Controller agreed. "But that's the price we have to pay for stability. You've got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We've sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead."
    - "Of course it does. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand."
    - "We could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. But we don't. We prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. For their own sakes–because it takes __longer__ to get food out of the land than out of a factory. Besides, we have our stability to think of. We don't want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. That's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. Yes, even science."
    - "Yes," Mustapha Mond was saying, "that's another item in the cost of stability. It isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also science. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled."

    - The book starts with a story not unlike [A Man's Search for Meaning](/a-man's-search-for-meaning){: .internal-link}. However, when it comes to the style, I much preferred [Victor L. Frankl](/victor-l.-frankl){: .internal-link}'s one.
    - I don't know why the author insists on using a lot of expletives, but it doesn't help with his message. One of the observations is that instead of looking for truth, people are looking for happiness and convenience. Yet, the simplistic and vulgar style suits better those convenient messages, rather than philosophical thougts (to which this book aspires).

    - The book starts with a story not unlike [A Man's Search for Meaning](/a-man's-search-for-meaning){: .internal-link}. However, when it comes to the style, I much preferred [Victor L. Frankl](/victor-l.-frankl){: .internal-link}'s one.
    - I don't know why the author insists on using a lot of expletives, but it doesn't help with his message. One of the observations is that instead of looking for truth, people are looking for happiness and convenience. Yet, the simplistic and vulgar style suits better those convenient messages, rather than philosophical thougts (to which this book aspires).

    - [Everything is F*cked](/everything-is-f-cked){: .internal-link} mentioned that [Freedom is not Free](/freedom-is-not-free){: .internal-link}. In a dialogue between [John (the Savage)](/john-(the-savage)){: .internal-link} and [Mustapha Mond](/mustapha-mond){: .internal-link}, John desires the freedom to be unhappy, the freedom to struggle, and the freedom to suffer. Citizens in the World State are protected from the unhappy as this may lead to instability.

    - "In those days, for a program to be popular enough it 
would have to be written for Windows. As consummate hackers, they loathed 
everything about Windows and had never bothered to learn how to develop 
applications for it. They preferred to write in Lisp and have the program run 
on Unix, the open-source operating system. 

They decided to postpone the inevitable and wrote the program for 
Unix anyway. To translate this later into Window's would be easy, but as they 
contemplated doing this, they realized the terrible consequences it would 
lead to—once the program was launched in Windows, they would have to 
deal with users and perfect the program based on their feedback. This would 
mean they would be forced to think and program in Windows for months, 
perhaps years. This was too awful a prospect, and they seriously considered 
giving up. 

One morning Graham, who had been sleeping on a mattress on the 
floor in Morris’s Manhattan apartment, woke up repealing certain words 
that must have come to him from a dream: “You could control the program 
by clicking on links.” He suddenly sat boll upright, as he realized what these 
words could mean—the possibility of creating a program to set up an online 
store that would run on the web server itself. People would download and 
use it through Netscape, clicking various links on the web page to set it up. 
This would mean he and Morris would bypass tire usual route of writing a 
program that users would download to their desktop. It would cut out the 
need ever to have to dabble in Windows. There was nothing out there like 
this, and yet it seemed like such an obvious solution. In a state of excitement 
he explained his epiphany to Morris, and they agreed to give it a try. Within 
a few days they finished the first version, and it functioned beautifully. 
Clearly, the concept of a web application would work."
    - "To help yourself to cultivate serendipity, you should keep a notebook with you at all times. The moment any idea or observation comes, you note 
it down. You keep the notebook by your bed, careful to record ideas that 
come in those moments of fringe awareness—just before falling asleep, or 
just upon waking. In this notebook you record any scrap of thought that 
occurs to you, and include drawings, quotes from other books, anything at 
all. In this way, you will have the freedom to try out the most absurd ideas. 
The juxtaposition of so many random bits will be enough to spark various 
associations. 

In general you must adopt a more analogical way of thinking, taking 
greater advantage of the associative powers of the mind. Thinking in terms 
of analogies and metaphors can be extremely helpful to the creative process. For instance, an argument people used in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries to prove that the earth does not move was to say that a rock dropped 
from a tower lands at its base. If the earth were moving, they argued, it would 
fall elsewhere. Galileo, a man who habitually thought in terms of analogies, 
saw the earth in his mind as a kind of sailing ship in space. As he explained 
to doubters of the earth’s movement, a rock dropped from the mast of a moving ship still tands at its base. 

These analogies can be tight and logical, such as Isaac Newton’s comparison of the falling apple from a tree in his garden to the moon falling in 
space. Or they can be loose and somewhat irrational, such as the jazz artist 
John Coltrane’s thinking of his own compositions as cathedrals of sound he 
was constructing. In any event, you must train yourself to look constantly 
for such analogies to reframe and expand your ideas."
    - "In order to work, the writer Samuel Johnson required that he had on his desk a cat, which he would periodically stroke to make it purr, and a slice of orange. Supposedly only these various sensual cues could properly stimulate him for his work. 

These examples are all related to the phenomenon of synesthesia- 
moments in which the stimulation of one sense provokes another. For instance, we hear a particular sound and it makes us think of a color. Studies 
have indicated that synesthesia is far more prevalent among artists and high- 
level thinkers. Some have speculated that synesthesia represents a high 
degree of interconnectivity in the brain, which also plays a role in intelligence. Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their 
senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate 
their thoughts on many levels—whether it be the smell of something strong, 
or the tactile feel of a rubber ball. What this means is that they are more open 
to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow 
themselves a broader range of sense experience. You must expand as well 
your notion of Lhinking and creativity beyond the confines of words and 
iniellectualizaiions. Stimulating your brain and senses from all directions 
will help unlock your natural creativity and help revive your original mind."
    - "As it panned out, the novelty of their idea, which Graham and Morris 
had come upon largely because of their distaste for Windows, proved to 
have all kinds of unforeseen advantages. Working directly on the Internet, 
they could generate a continuous stream of new releases of the software and 
test them right away. They could interact directly with consumers, getting 
instant feedback on their program and improving it in days rather than the 
months it could take with desktop software. With no experience running a 
business, they did not think to hire salespeople to do the pitching; instead, 
they made the phone calls to potential clients themselves. But as they were 
the de facto salespeople, they were also the first to hear complaints or suggestions from consumers, and this gave them a real feel for the program’s weaknesses and how to improve it. Because it was so unique and came out of left 
field, they had no competitors to worry about; nobody could steal the idea 
because they were the only ones who were insane enough to attempt it."

    - One of the insights from the book was that you are not building company culture because it helps you when everything is going well. Company culture is there for when the things go wrong. When people work long hours and the competition seems to be crushing your company, great culture is what keeps people working for the company.

    - "These procedural and political rules may be dysfunctional or counterproductive, but your job is not to moralize about this or complain, but merely to understand them, to get a complete lay of the land. You are like an anthropologist studying an alien culture, attuned to all of its nuances and conventions. You are not there to change that culture; you will only end up being killed, or in the case of work, fired. Later, when you have attained power and mastery, you will be the one to rewrite or destroy these same rules."
    - "Although there are many ways in which this could influence the concept of aprrenticeship, it is the hacker approach to programming that may offer the most promising model for this new age.
The model goes like this: You want to learn as many skills as possible, following the direction that circumstances lead you to, but only if they are related to your deepest interests. Like a hacker, you value the process of self-discovery and making things that are of the highest quality. You avoid the trap of following one set career path, you are not sure where this will all lead, but you are taking full advantage of the openness of information, all of the knowledge about skills at our disposal."

    - Started "The Checklist Manifesto" by [Atul Gawande](/atul-gawande){: .internal-link} .

For such a boring title, it starts enormously exciting.

The stories of death, near-death, and subsequent revival from various operating rooms got me really hooked!
    - "He tried the usual surgical approach to remedy this—yelling at everyone to get their act together."
    - As with "Why We Sleep?" this is one of the books I have to consume in small portions a time. Not that it's boring (even though the titles is far from exciting). Quite the opposite. There's so much information that I have to process it before getting to the next part.
    - I'm not yet in the middle of the book, and so far I've learned about:
        - - intricacies of surgeons' jobs
        - - the miracle revival of a 3yo girl drowned in cold water in Austria that has been technically dead for an hour or two
        - - how the construction workers make sure the buildings won't collapse and serve their purpose
        - - the emergency response to hurricane and flood damage by both public and private sectors
        - - how world-class chefs make sure their restaurant serve meals of the highest quality

    - I've listened to it as an audiobook read by the author, [Gary John Bishop](/gary-john-bishop){: .internal-link}. I so loved the Scottish accent!
    - The book is more or less a collection of affirmations with the acompanying rationale to why these affirmations are important.
    - Rather than a book, I will call it a script for a motivational speech with a twist. What's the twist? The twist is that the author denounces most motivational speeches and instead on positivity, he focuses on rationality.
    - The book is full of quotes, mostly from stoic philosophers. At first, I thought this was a nice addition. After a while, I got a little bored by how they are placed.
    - Fun fact: it made me realize body building is not only about body building. It is also about learning how to pose. In other words: what we see is not how well does the body builder look. It is how well the body builder can pose with the given body.
    - One point reminded me of [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things){: .internal-link}. It was the bias towards action instead of dwelling on your thoughts and worries. It struck me as I'm particularly guilty of overthinking and having trouble making the decision. [Ben Horowitz](/ben-horowitz){: .internal-link} mentioned that one of the features of a great CEO is the ability to make a decision and stick to it even if it's tough and there's a high uncertainty about it. That's what people expect from a great CEO. You won't please everybody, so decide on what to do and start doing it. Good thoughts are fine, but you are judged by your actions.
