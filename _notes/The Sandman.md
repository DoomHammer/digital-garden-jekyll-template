    - Day 2 of listening to The Sandman Audio Drama.

It's still very very good! The team managed to convey the original atmosphere and add a few gifts of their own.

    - Day 3 of The Sandman Audio Drama.

I wonder if I'll be able to follow the plot if I haven't read the original first. That said, it's still great and evoking all the emotions that were present when I first read it.

Too bad no "Mr. Sandman" or "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (yet)

    - Day 5 of The Sandman Audio Drama.

Oh my, I almost forgotten how much I loved "24 hours"!

    - Yesterday was day 4 of The Sandman Audio Drama. Finally, I got some "Mr. Sandman".

The voice and the manner of speech of the Morpheus is not something I would expect from a figure like this, but I think I like it anyway.

Still within "Preludes & Nocturnes".

    - Day... (Do days matter anymore?) of The Sandman Audio Drama.

It's "The Doll's House" and it's still splendid. Lovely! Better than I expected ( which is rarely the case with adaptations for me)

Also, I feel I'm watched by a gargoyle.

Meep?

    - One of my favorite stories from "The Sandman" has always been "[A Dream of a Thousand Cats](<A Dream of a Thousand Cats>)".

It is astory about how dreams shape the world. And at that, it is one of the truest and most human stories. After all, the only advantage homo sapiens has over other animals is our ability to turn our dreams into reality. To shape the world we live in according to our dreams.

If enough people can dream that money is good for trade then trade can happen.

If enough people believe democracy is the way to govern the world, ...
    - ...the democracy can happen.

If enough people believe in the Internet, the Internet can happen.

We live in the world of our dreams.

But "A Dream of a Thousand Cats" touches other topics as well.

It is a story about the power of the collective. About the drawbacks...
    - ...of individualism and selfishness.

I've seen a few beautiful things crumble, because the people that made them stopped dreaming the same dreams.

"A Dream of a Thousand Cats" is also the most human, because it shows not only our power but also our cruelty. In that, ...
    - ...it reminds me of "Sapiens" by [Yuval Noah Harari](<Yuval Noah Harari>).

It also shows that freedom can be easily gave up in exchange for comfort. And that we will fool oursleves that this comfort comes at modest price (isn't it similar to what we do with our personal data right now?).

When I read ...
    - ...it for the first time, I wouldn't dream to hear it one day narrated by
    - [@neilhimself](https://twitter.com/neilhimself)
    -  .

But as it turned out, thanks to The Sandman Audio Drama, I had this wonderful opportunity.

Even though, it is part of "The Sandman", this story works very well out of context. You can...
    - ...read it without touching the rest of the series and you will get the main point.

And if you are anything like me, you'll be touched by it.

If you get this far, ask yourself what your dreams are. Then, ask yourself how you may realize them. If you find enough people who...
    - ...will share those dreams with you, one day, your dreams may become reality.
